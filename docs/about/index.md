# What is OMG, Data ... WTF?

The site is mostly venting about the crappy data that we have to deal with every day in cultural heritage.

Hopefully it's amusing and cathartic for you that there's other people out there, with equally crappy data.

## Contributions

If you would like to contribute, the site is all markdown and managed in [github](https://github.com/azaroth42/omgdata-wtf). Pull Requests Welcome... those three little meaningless words, but they really are and they're not hard. But probably you saw the little github icon and stars in the top right already.

The site is rendered using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) which I also use for [linked.art](https://linked.art/) now.
